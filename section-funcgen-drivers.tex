\chapter{Function Generator Drivers}
\label{sec:funcgen-drivers}

This chapter describes all of the available drivers for standalone function generators.

Function generators which are part of an oscilloscope are described in the \hyperref[sec:scope-drivers]{Oscilloscope
Drivers} section.

XDG 2000/3000 series & owon\_xdg & lan/usbtmc & Only tested via lan transport, but USBTMC is available too.\\
\thickhline
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{owon\_xdg}

This driver supports all XDG 2000/3000 series function / arbitrary waveform generators.

It has been tested on an Owon XDG 2035.

The default communication port for lan is 3000.
